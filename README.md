# Welcome!
I am James, a third year mathematics student at the University of Durham, with a passion for technology.
Have a look around, see if you find anything interesting!
I am also seeking work in the technology field, specifically in data science. 

### Experience and Projects
*Barclays: Internship (summer 2021)
    * I spent 8 weeks in the technology internship program at Barclays. This time was spent building a tool to help developers deploy applications to AWS services using cloudformation.
    * I worked in a team of four interns to deliver the tool, which received a good reception from project sponsors.
    * The project involved writing cloudformation templates using YAML for the S3, API Gateway, NLBs, Lambda, DynamoDB, and other services. We also used python to write tools to populate sample templates with user input, and to build a command line interface to allow developers to interact with the tool.
*Mathematical Modelling (autumn 2020)
    * As part of my mathematical modelling course at university I undertook a project to model bridge oscillations in a suspension bridge.
    * This involved using Python, with particularly heavy use of the numpy and matplotlib libraries to solve linked differential equations and display results.

### Skills
*Python: I have experience using Python for a range of projects. On my page you will see my solutions to the advent of code problems (adventofcode.com) using python. I have experience in many libraries and APIs (including numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, click, pyyaml and more) and in unit testing through both pytest and unittest.
*AWS: During my time at barclays my project involved automating many steps of deploying a serverless react application through AWS. This required using cloudformation templates to create a number of resources, ranging from S3 buckets, load balancers, security keys and many more. We then used the AWS SAM CLI to deploy and manage these resources.
*R: During my time at university I have used the R language during my Statistics courses to complete statistical analysis on data, for example with bayesian analysis, linear regression, and both parametric and non parametric hypothesis testing.
*Other Languages:
