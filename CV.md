I'm James, a current third year Mathematics student at Durham University. I am seeking graduate work in a role that allows me to combine my passions of mathematics and software development, with the goal of working towards a career in machine learning or data science.
### Experience and Education
* Durham University Mathematics(2019-ongoing)
    * I am currently going into my third year of mathematics, taking courses in Statical Methods, Bayesian Statistics, Stochastic Processes, and Mathematical Finance, and completing a project on Machine Learning. Last year I took a number of courses, involving pure topics like Algebra and Topolgy, and applied topics, like Monte Carlo methods. I also took a Mathematical Modelling course, which involved two projects, using Python to model the Covid-19 pandemic and modelling oscillations in a suspecinsion bridge. These projects involved heavy use of the Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib modules to process and present data.
    * I also was a keen member of my colleges rugby and football teams.
* Barclays Technology Internship (summer 2021)
    * I spent 8 weeks in the technology internship program at Barclays. This time was spent building a tool to help developers deploy applications to AWS services using cloudformation.
    * I worked in a team of four interns to deliver the tool, which received a good reception from project sponsors.
    * The project involved writing cloudformation templates using YAML for the S3, API Gateway, NLBs, Lambda, DynamoDB, and other services. We also used python to write tools to populate sample templates with user input, and to build a command line interface to allow developers to interact with the tool.
* King Edward VI School, Stratford upon Avon (2012-2019)
    * I attended KES stratford, achieving A levels in Maths (A*), Further Maths (A*), Economics (A*), and Physics (A*). I also played in the schools 1<sup>st</sup> XV for Rugby, founded the Maths and Physics Society, recieved colours and was made a house captain.

### Skills
* Python
    * I have experience using Python for a range of projects. On my page you will see my solutions to the [advent of code problems](http://www.adventofcode.com) using python. I have experience in many libraries and APIs (including numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, click, pyyaml and more), and in unit testing through both pytest and unittest. During my time at Barclays I used Python to code a command line tool to populate AWS Cloudformation templates with user input. I also used Python to model bridge oscillations and the spread of Covid-19 during my mathematical modelling course at university. 
* Statistics and Probablity
    * During my time at university I have naturally gravitated towards the areas of Statistics and Probablity. Over the two year I have so far completed I have explored topics such as Hypothesis testing (both parametric and non-parametric), Bayesian vs Frequentist Statistics, and Linear regression in Statistics, and Markov chains, Monte Carlo Methods, and Generating functions in Probability.
    * I have also spent time combining these skills with my passion for programming, both throughout my university courses and outside, some examples of which can be seen here on my Github.
* AWS Cloudformation
    * During my time at Barclays my project involved automating many steps of deploying a serverless react application onto AWS. This required using cloudformation templates in YAML to create a number of resources, ranging from S3 buckets, load balancers, security keys and many more. We then used the AWS SAM CLI to deploy and manage these resources.
* JavaScript
    * I have familiarity using basic JS syntax, and a rudimentary understanding of the React framework. During my time at Barclays I used React to design a basic UI that allowed users input data, and then make HTTP requests to communicate with an AWS Lambda.
* R
    * During my time at university I have used the R language during my Statistics courses to complete statistical analysis on data, for example with bayesian analysis, linear regression, and both parametric and non parametric hypothesis testing.

I have also taught myself the basics of SQL (using MySQL) and Haskell. I am passionate about learning new skills, and always on the lookout for new skills or technologies to explore
